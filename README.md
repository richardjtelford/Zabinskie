This repository includes all the code needed to replicate the manuscript "The limits of high-resolution quantitative palaeoecology" which explores the ecological, taphonomic and chronological challenges faced by sub-decadal resolution palaeoenvironmental reconstructions from microfossil assemblages using transfer functions. 

The manuscript also examines the available data for several chironomid-based reconstructions and finds several errors and anomalous patterns.

Some data will need to be downloaded from public archives. The code will report when data are missing.
