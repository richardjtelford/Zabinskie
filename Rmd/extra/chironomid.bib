  Abstract                 = {Diatom assemblages in the annually laminated sediments of two neighboring, pre-alpine lakes (Ammersee and Starnberger See, Southern Germany) were analyzed and compared year by year. Within both varve records of the last decades, the same 4-phase-succession of planktonic diatom species is preserved, consisting of 1. a dominance of Cyclotella species 2. assemblages of Fragilaria crotonensis, Asterionella formosa and Stephanodiscus minutulus 3. a mass bloom of Aulacoseira islandica, and 4. a dominance of Stephanodiscus species. This diatom sequence is considered as a model of a 'basic species sequence of eutrophication'. Time lags and differences in the duration of the phases between both lakes show evidence of an earlier start for nutrient loading in Starnberger See than in Ammersee, and a faster development to a higher trophic state level in the latter. The different reactions of the lakes are attributed to hydrological differences such as the existence or lack of a major tributary, the size of the catchment area, and the water residence time. The reconstruction of the eutrophication dynamics appears to be reliably hindcast by the inference of total phosphorus (TP) concentrations using weighted averaging regression and calibration techniques. Remarkable differences in the occurrence of some diatoms in both stratigraphies, which are not related to the general changes of the 'basic species sequence of eutrophication' model, may be due to the epilimnetic silica content (e.g. Fragilaria crotonensis) or competitive weaknesses (e.g. Tabellaria flocculosa).},

Two training sets were used derived from Canadian and Eastern Canadian transfer functions. Both models reconstructed similar climate patterns, but the Canadian model provided temperatures generally 2–3 °C lower than the Eastern Canadian model. Three main thermal changes inferred by chironomids were: (i) the Holocene Thermal Maximum, which occurred between 8 and 5k cal a BP, with temperatures generally higher than today's, maximum temperatures between 8 and 6.5k cal a BP, and an average of + 0.9 °C; (ii) the Medieval Climate Anomaly around 1.1–1.2k cal a BP with an amplitude of + 0.7 °C; and (iii) a colder period reconstructed between the 14th and 19th centuries, corresponding to the Little Ice Age, with summer temperatures on average −0.5 °C lower than the climate normal. For each of these three climatic events, the timing and the amplitude of changes were similar with other published regional, North American and Northern Hemisphere records.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract A set of 12 homogenized monthly mean temperature and precipitation series of Switzerland for the period 1864–2000 are introduced. The standardized homogenization procedure, which has been developed and implemented at MeteoSwiss during recent years, is briefly reviewed and the inhomogeneity types, causes, magnitudes, and timings are discussed. Finally, a trend analysis is performed on each temperature and precipitation series and on a mean temperature series of Switzerland. The results are compared with findings of other studies that have examined long-term temperature and precipitation trends in Switzerland and neighbouring countries. The inhomogeneities of the Swiss temperature series are up to ±1.6 °C and the precipitation adjustment factors vary between 0.5 and 1.6. Each of the 12 temperature series analysed contains several inhomogeneities that cause systematic biases in the adjustment curves. The slope of a mean temperature curve derived from the original data is underestimated by 0.4 °C/100 years. All precipitation series except one contain inhomogeneities, but no systematic bias is observed. The trend analysis reveals an increase in the yearly temperature series ranging from 0.9 °C/100 years to 1.1 °C/100 years at stations north of the alpine main crest and ∼0.6 °C/100 years at southern stations. Precipitation trends are observed at most sites north of the alpine main crest in winter and in some of the yearly series. The annual slopes vary between 7 and 10\% and the winter slopes between 16 and 37\%. Copyright © 2005 Royal Meteorological Society},

  Abstract                 = {Sedimentary diatom assemblages from three lakes in the southeastern Swiss Alps were analysed at high temporal resolution since AD 1800. Altered land-use patterns, increasing population and exploitation through tourism are clearly reflected in annually laminated sediments of Lej da San Murezzan (Lake St Moritz) and Lej da Silvaplauna (Lake Silvaplana). Diatom assemblages originally dominated by Cyclotella taxa are replaced by taxa indicating higher total phosphorus (TP) concentrations, such as Asterionella formosa, Fragilaria crotonensis and Stephanodiscus parvus. In Lej da la Tscheppa, located well above the treeline in a catchment that was hardly exposed to human impact, Cyclotella comensis prevails throughout the entire sediment sequence. Quantitative estimates of past TP concentrations were inferred using a newly developed regional diatom-TP inference model based on 119 modern samples. In Lej da la Tscheppa diatoms imply stable, low TP concentrations (~10 µg/l), which can be considered as natural background concentration. Elevated TP levels are inferred for Lej da San Murezzan (max. 60 µg/l) since AD 1910 and for Lej da Silvaplauna (max. 40 µg/l) since AD 1950, corroborated by changes in sedimentary biogenic silica concentration and organic carbon content. Since ~AD 1970 improved waste water management led to a considerable reduction in TP loading in Lej da Silvaplauna and Lej da San Murezzan.},

  Abstract                 = { We found a significant positive correlation between local summer air temperature (May-September) and the annual sediment mass accumulation rate (MAR) in Lake Silvaplana (46°N, 9°E, 1800 m a.s.l.) during the twentieth century (r = 0.69, p < 0.001 for decadal smoothed series). Sediment trap data (2001-2005) confirm this relation with exceptionally high particle yields during the hottest summer of the last 140 years in 2003. On this base we developed a decadal-scale summer temperature reconstruction back to AD 1580. Surprisingly, the comparison of our reconstruction with two other independent regional summer temperature reconstructions (based on tree-rings and documentary data) revealed a significant negative correlation for the pre-1900 data (ie, late ‘Little Ice Age’). This demonstrates that the correlation between MAR and summer temperature is not stable in time and the actualistic principle does not apply in this case. We suggest that different climatic regimes (modern/‘Little Ice Age’) lead to changing state conditions in the catchment and thus to considerably different sediment transport mechanisms. Therefore, we calibrated our MAR data with gridded early instrumental temperature series from AD 1760-1880 (r = -0.48, p < 0.01 for decadal smoothed series) to properly reconstruct the late LIA climatic conditions. We found exceptionally low temperatures between AD 1580 and 1610 (0.75°C below twentieth-century mean) and during the late Maunder Minimum from AD 1680 to 1710 (0.5°C below twentieth-century mean). In general, summer temperatures did not experience major negative departures from the twentieth-century mean during the late ‘Little Ice Age’. This compares well with the two existing independent regional reconstructions suggesting that the LIA in the Alps was mainly a phenomenon of the cold season. },

They suggest ways in which the reliability of chironomid-based paleotemperature reconstructions could be improved by taking into account ecological complexity. While we agree with many of their recommendations, based on the results of other work, we think their paper is unnecessarily pessimistic regarding the ability of existing chironomid-based temperature inference models to provide reliable estimates of past temperature. We offer a critique of the main points discussed by Velle et al. (2010) and provide evidence that chironomid-based temperature inference models can reliably reconstruct mean July air temperature in the Lateglacial and Holocene over millennial and centennial timescales. },

We tested this technique with a sample of 260 recent empirical articles in leading journals. Of the articles that we could test with the GRIM technique (N = 71), around half (N = 36) appeared to contain at least one inconsistent mean, and more than 20\% (N = 16) contained multiple such inconsistencies. We requested the data sets corresponding to 21 of these articles, receiving positive responses in 9 cases. We confirmed the presence of at least one reporting error in all cases, with three articles requiring extensive corrections. The implications for the reliability and replicability of empirical psychology are discussed. },

  Abstract                 = { Little is known about the burrows of sediment-dwelling insects because these structures are concealed by the sediment in which the animals live. We used X-ray images to reveal and compare the burrowing behavior in the laboratory of aquatic insects from several orders (Diptera, Ephemeroptera, Megaloptera, Trichoptera). Most of the taxa studied constructed U-shaped burrows. Exceptionally, individual caddisfly larvae (Polycentropus sp.) varied greatly in the type of burrow they constructed, i.e., I-, J- and U-shaped burrows were observed. Most taxa begin new burrows from preexisting ones under the sediment surface, obviating the need for the animals to leave the sediment and thereby minimizing their exposure to potential predators. Nymphs of the mayfly Hexagenia limbata exceeded all of the other taxa studied in terms of the depth and length of their burrows and their burrowing rate. Our data suggest that nymphs of H. limbata could be responsible for 98\% of the volume of sediment disturbed by littoral insects in our study lake. Observations on 3 species of Chironomus suggest that the rate of burrow construction can differ among congeners. Individuals of H. limbata and Sialis velata burrowed to greater depth in the autumn than in the spring. Our study illustrates the potential of radiographs to study the behavior of burrowing animals, and the range of variability in burrowing behaviors among genera and species of insects. },

  Abstract                 = { High-resolution climate reconstructions from a range of natural archives across the world are fundamental to place current climate change into perspective. Paleoclimate records for the Southern Hemisphere are scarce and only a few quantitative high-resolution reconstructions exist for the past millennium. We present a record of annually laminated sediments of Lago Plomo (46°59′S, 72°52′W,203 m a.s.l.) located east of the Northern Patagonian Ice Field (NPI). Radiometric dating (210Pb, 137Cs, 14C AMS) is consistent with counts of millimetre-scale laminae, confirming the annual nature of the laminae couplets with a light summer and a dark winter layer. The varves were analyzed for thickness, mass accumulation rate (MAR), scanning x-ray fluorescence (XRF) and scanning reflectance spectroscopy in the visible range (VIS-RS). MAR data were calibrated against austral winter (JJA) precipitation data (CRU TS 3.0) for the period ad 1930–2002 (r = 0.67, p(aut) < 0.05). Using a linear inverse regression model we reconstructed winter precipitation for Lago Plomo back to ad 1530. The root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) is small (13.3 mm/month; 12\% of the average precipitation) compared with the pronounced decadal and multidecadal variability, suggesting that most of the reconstructed variability is significant. Wetter phases (reference ad 1930–2002) were observed around ad 1600, ad 1630–1690 and ad 1780–1850, and a prolonged drier period ad 1690–1780 with a multidecadal minimum centered on ad 1770. The spatial correlation for South America suggests that the JJA precipitation record from Lago Plomo is representative for large areas in the southwest between c. 41°S and 51°S. },

  Abstract                 = {The frequency with which scientists fabricate and falsify data, or commit other forms of scientific misconduct is a matter of controversy. Many surveys have asked scientists directly whether they have committed or know of a colleague who committed research misconduct, but their results appeared difficult to compare and synthesize. This is the first meta-analysis of these surveys. To standardize outcomes, the number of respondents who recalled at least one incident of misconduct was calculated for each question, and the analysis was limited to behaviours that distort scientific knowledge: fabrication, falsification, “cooking” of data, etc… Survey questions on plagiarism and other forms of professional misconduct were excluded. The final sample consisted of 21 surveys that were included in the systematic review, and 18 in the meta-analysis. A pooled weighted average of 1.97% (N = 7, 95%CI: 0.86-4.45) of scientists admitted to have fabricated, falsified or modified data or results at least once -a serious form of misconduct by any standard- and up to 33.7% admitted other questionable research practices. In surveys asking about the behaviour of colleagues, admission rates were 14.12% (N = 12, 95% CI: 9.91-19.72) for falsification, and up to 72% for other questionable research practices. Meta-regression showed that self reports surveys, surveys using the words “falsification” or “fabrication”, and mailed surveys yielded lower percentages of misconduct. When these factors were controlled for, misconduct was reported more frequently by medical/pharmacological researchers than others. Considering that these surveys ask sensitive questions and have other limitations, it appears likely that this is a conservative estimate of the true prevalence of scientific misconduct.},

  Abstract                 = { Rapid ecosystem transitions and adverse effects on ecosystem services as responses to combined climate and human impacts are of major concern. Yet few long-term (i.e. >60 years) quantitative observational time series exist, particularly for ecosystems that have a long history of human intervention. Here, we combine three major environmental pressures (land use, nutrients and erosion) with quantitative summer and winter climate reconstructions and climate model simulations to explore the system dynamics, resilience and the role of disturbance regimes in varved eutrophic Lake Żabińskie (NE Poland) since AD 1000. The comparison between these independent sources of information allows us to establish the coherence and points of disagreements between such data sets. We find that climate reconstructions capture noticeably natural forced climate variability, while internal variability is the dominant source of variability during most parts of the last millennium at the regional scale, precisely at which climate models seem to underestimate forced variability. Using different multivariate analyses and change point detection techniques, we identify ecosystem changes through time and shifts between rather stable states and highly variable ones. Prior to AD 1600, the lake ecosystem was characterised by high stability and resilience against observed natural climate variability. During this period, the anthropogenic fingerprint was small; the lake ecosystem was buffered against the combined human and natural disturbance. In contrast, lake–ecosystem conditions started to fluctuate across a broad range of states after AD 1600. The period AD 1745–1886 represents the phase with the strongest human disturbance of the catchment–lake ecosystem. During that time, the range of natural climate variability did not increase. Analyses of the frequency of change points in the multi-proxy data set suggest that the last 400 years were highly variable and increased vulnerability of the ecosystem to the anthropogenic disturbances. This led to significant rapid ecosystem transformations. },

  Abstract                 = {Chrysophyte cyst assemblages from sediment trap and surface sediment samples of 50 lakes in northern Poland were related to environmental variables using multivariate numerical analyses (DCA, CCA). Water electric conductivity, total nitrogen, total phosphorous, turbidity, and cation and anion compositions (Ca2+, HCO3 −) accounted for significant and independent variations in the chrysophyte cyst assemblages. The first canonical axis was related to the gradient of Ca2+ while the second axis was correlated with total nitrogen. A quantitative transfer function was then developed to estimate Ca2+ (log10 transformed) from modern chrysophyte cyst assemblages using weighted-averaging regression with classical deshrinking. The bootstrapped regression coefficient ( {\$}{\$} {\{}{\backslash}text{\{}R{\}}{\}}{\_}{\{}{\backslash}text{\{}boot{\}}{\}}^{\{}2{\}} {\$}{\$} R boot 2 ) was 0.68, with a root-mean square error of prediction of 0.143 (log10 units). The calibration model was applied to a varved sedimentary sequence (AD 1898--2010) from Lake {\.{Z}}abi{\'{n}}skie, Masurian Lakeland (NE Poland). Observational data from this lake show that the Ca2+ variability in the epilimnion depends on the efficiency of Ca2+ scavenging by CaCO3 precipitation in early summer, which in turn is a function of water column stratification, temperature and the wind regime from late spring to early fall. The spring-fall wind regime drives the water column mixing. In Lake {\.{Z}}abi{\'{n}}skie, cyst-inferred warm-season lake water Ca2+ concentrations are significantly negatively correlated with calcite precipitation (CaCO3 concentrations in sediments; R = − 0.49, padj < 0.001; AD 1898--2010; 3-year filtered), and cyst-inferred lake water Ca2+ concentrations are significantly correlated with zonal wind speed (m s−1) (R = 0.50; padj < 0.001; AD 1898--2010; 3-year filtered). This study demonstrates that chrysophyte cyst assemblages in Polish lakes respond to hydrochemical factors driven by climate variability.},

  Abstract                 = { High-resolution analysis of ombrogenous peats often reveals pollen frequencies that change markedly from one sample to the next, indicating limited postdepositional mixing. This raises the question whether — with sufficiently thin samples — seasonal differences in pollen deposition can be observed. Seasonal resolution in peat would provide a dating technique with an accuracy similar to that of other, annually banded archives. To study the limits of temporal resolution, contiguous 0.5 mm thick slices of slightly humified Sphagnum section Cuspidata peat were palynologically analysed. No seasonal patterns in the pollen stratigraphy could be observed. This is ascribed to the mixing of pollen grains as a result of small-scaled vertical water movements and to the horizontal mode of shoot layering in the Sphagnum species. The latter process may also be the cause of a smoothed annual signal. Because of the absence of seasonal differentiation, the palynological distinction of annual peat layers is not feasible. },

  Abstract                 = {Quantitative reconstructions of past environmental conditions (e.g., pH) are an important part of palaeolimnology. Such reconstructions involve three steps: (1) the development of a representative modern organism-environment training-set, (2) the development and application of appropriate numerical techniques to model the relationship between modern occurrences and abundances of the organisms in the training-set and their contemporary environment, and (3) the application of this model to stratigraphical palaeolimnological data to infer past environmental conditions, and model selection, testing, and evaluation and assessment of the final reconstruction. These three stages are discussed. Problems of spatial autocorrelation are outlined. The general approach is illustrated by a case-study. The assumptions and limitations of the calibration-function approach are presented, and violations of these assumptions are discussed in relation to different environmental reconstructions. Appropriate computer software is outlined, and future research areas are presented. The chapter challenges palaeolimnologists to be more critical of their environmental-inference models and to be alert to the problems and dangers of confounding variables, and of violating the main assumptions of the approach.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The objective of this study was to develop a high‐resolution pollen‐based climate inference model (using ‘calibration in time’) for the mire Mauntschas (SE Swiss Alps, 1818 m above sea level). We focused on 11 types of pollen and spores (referred to as pollen for simplicity) for which we produced 150 year (a) time series of accumulation rates and percentages. Dating of these series was based on 29 14C dates from pure Sphagnum, spheroidal carbonaceous particles, larch bud moth events, and an age–depth model that took into account probabilities of calibrated 14C ages, the degree of curvature of the age–depth line and changes in concentrations of all major pollen types. Time resolution was 1–5 a. We first smoothed the series using a 3 a triangular filter, thus removing time‐resolution dependent changes in variability, and minimising effects of potential dating uncertainties. Using redundancy analysis, we then studied the simultaneous response of the selected pollen to 288 different combinations of monthly temperature or precipitation data measured at Sils Maria (1798 m above sea level), located 9 km from Mauntschas. From AD 1954 to 2002, mean May–August air temperature from the same year explained most (18.1\%) of the variation in pollen accumulation rates. The amount of explained variation dropped to 9.9\% after detrending all data with a 50 a high‐pass filter, which possibly removed non‐climatic trends. Temperature explained more variation among PAR than among pollen percentages; however, during the verification period (AD 1864–1953) the former were potentially affected by dating uncertainties and could not be used. For developing a pollen‐based temperature inference model, we tested ordinary least squares regression, time series regression, ridge regression, principal components regression, and partial least squares regression. During the well‐dated calibration period (AD 1954–2002), ordinary least squares regression based on percentages of six pollen types turned out to be the most parsimonious model, having a cross‐validated root mean square error of prediction of 0.23°C for mean April–November temperature. A comparison of reconstructed with measured temperature from Sils Maria during the verification period showed that the model best reflected long‐term (at least decadal‐scale) temperature changes.

  Abstract                 = {Reliable estimates of Holocene temperatures are important for understanding past climate dynamics, the response of biota to climate change, and validating climate models. Chironomids in lake sediment cores are used widely to quantify past summer temperatures, for which high-latitude and/or high-altitude lakes, remote from human influence, are usually considered appropriate. Temperature inferences from lowland lakes are likely influenced by other variables, specifically eutrophication and industrial pollution, but their reliability has never been tested. We used a Norwegian chironomid-based transfer function (r 2 = 0.91; RMSEP = 1.01 {\textdegree}C) to infer mean July air temperature over the last 200 years, using chironomid assemblages in a core collected from a polluted, nutrient-enriched lake at Speke Hall, Liverpool, England. The chironomid-inferred temperatures correlate significantly with the local instrumental temperature record and follow long-term national temperature trends. These results show that chironomids can be used to produce reliable estimates of past mean July air temperature, even when other variables have also influenced the composition of the chironomid community. These findings underline the value of chironomids as sensitive and reliable quantitative proxies for summer temperature.},

At near-annual resolution, the general patterns of chironomid-inferred temperature changes followed the meteorological record over the last ∼150 years (r Pearson = 0.65, P = 0.01) and 87{\%} of the inferences had deviations from the instrumental data below the root-mean-square error of prediction (RMSEP). When the inferences were compared with a 2-year running mean in the meteorological data, 94{\%} of the inferences had differences with the instrumental data below the RMSEP, indicating that more than half of the inaccurate inferences may have been due to errors in varve counting. Larger deviations from the instrumental data were also obtained from samples with low percentages of fossil taxa represented in the training set used for temperature reconstruction and/or assemblages with poor fit to temperature. Changes in total phosphorus (TP, as inferred by diatoms) and/or greater precipitation were possible factors affecting the accuracy of the temperature reconstruction. Although these factors might affect the quantitative estimates, obtaining >80{\%} accurate temperature inferences suggests that chironomid analysis is a reliable tool for reconstructing mean July air temperature quantitatively over the last ∼150 years in Lake Silvaplana.},

  Abstract                 = {This study evaluates the potential of using chironomid assemblages to estimate past temperature changes by comparing chironomid-inferred temperatures to meteorological data for the last 87 years. This comparison is made using high-resolution (i.e., sub-decadally resolved) short cores of four lakes along a gradient of altitude (Lake Njulla, 999 m a.s.l., Lake 850, 850 m a.s.l., Lake Alanen Laanijavri, 365 m a.s.l. and Lake Vuoskkujavri, 348 m a.s.l.), vegetation (pine forest to alpine tundra vegetation) and temperature (mean July temperature of 12.4 to 8.1{\textdegree}C). Patterns of chironomid-inferred changes in mean July air temperature were highly comparable to changes in the meteorological data. Moreover, instrumental data were almost always within the specific errors of the quantitative estimates using chironomids. These results indicate that chironomids can be used as a powerful tool to reconstruct temperatures and that chironomids are sensitive enough to record temperature changes of low magnitude such as those recorded during the Holocene. Although this relationship between temperature and chironomid community is strong for the last 87 years, we cannot assume that other environmental factors such as organic matter, changes of lake water depth or oxygen availability were not more significant over longer temporal scales of the Holocene, or longer.},

  Abstract                 = {The temperature reconstruction obtained from chironomids preserved in the sediment of Egelsee, Switzerland, was partially flawed by the low percentages of fossil taxa represented in the Swiss calibration set (Larocque-Tobler et al. 2009a). Transfer functions (TFs) from other regions, which allow a good representation of the fossil taxa (>80{\%}), could be applied to the fossil assemblages of Egelsee. First, the validity of using two (a Swedish and a North American (NA)) TFs was tested by comparing the chironomid-inferred temperatures with instrumental data. Since good relationships (rPearson = 0.71 and 0.61, p = 0.001 for the NA and Swedish TFs, respectively) were obtained, these two models were used to reconstruct the Late Glacial and early Holocene periods at Egelsee. Reconstructions using both models showed clear cold periods during the Younger Dryas and the so-called 8,200 calibrated years BP event. However, the amplitude of changes during these periods was higher when the NA transfer function was used, probably due to the fact that 37{\%} of the taxa in the core had temperature optima colder in the NA than in the Swedish and Swiss models. The results indicate that TFs from other regions can be applied when they are based on samples with good modern analogues, however, caution should be taken when the amplitude of temperature changes is considered.},

  Abstract                 = { Chironomids were used to reconstruct mean July air temperatures between c. AD 1580 and 2001 at Lake Silvaplana, a varved lake located in the Engadine, eastern Swiss Alps. The goal of this study was to reconstruct temperature changes at near-annual resolution, and validate the reconstruction by comparison with records based on early instrumental data, documentary proxy evidence, dendrochronology, geochemical (biogenic silica (BSi)) and mineralogical data (quartz/mica ratios) at local and regional scales. Warmer than-the-climate-normal (AD 1961—1990) mean July air temperatures were inferred between c. AD 1610 and 1662, AD 1710 and 1740, AD 1790 and 1866, AD 1940 and 1960 and AD 1990 and 2001. Colder-than-the-climate-normal July air temperatures were reconstructed between c. AD 1662 and 1710, AD 1740 and 1790, AD 1866 and 1919, and AD 1970 and 1990. The 420-year chironomid-inferred mean July air temperature record was significantly (p < 0.01) related to June—September (JJAS) temperatures reconstructed from early instrumental and documentary data at regional scale, JJA temperature inferred from documentary proxy evidence at local scale and summer temperatures based on early instrumental data in central Europe. When the Z-scores of warm/cold periods were compared between records, only one period (c. AD 1740—1790) did not show significant correlations between the chironomid record and any of the eight other records considered here, probably because of increased precipitation and changes in the sediment composition which influenced the chironomid assemblages. 75\% of the periods considered had significant correlations between the chironomid records, and both the reconstruction based on quartz/mica ratios and the inferred JJAS early instrumental and documentary proxy evidence, while 60\% of the periods showed significant correlations between the chironomid-based record and the reconstruction based on early instrumental data of Central Europe. These results suggest that chironomids in the sediment of Lake Silvaplana yield valid temperature reconstructions at regional scales for the last 420 years. },

  Abstract                 = { Processes leading to the formation of varves in proglacial Oeschinensee (Switzerland) are investigated. The aim is to calibrate annually-laminated sediments of the last three decades against hydrological and meteorological instrumental data. Results from water samples and sediment traps show that the suspended sediment in the lake is mainly distributed by underflows during the time of the largest sediment input from May to mid-August. This leads to the deposition of the basal silt layers of the varves. Settling of fine-grained suspension from interflows dominates sedimentation between August and October, forming the final layer of fine-grained material at the end of the annual deposition cycle. The median grain-size at the top of the varves is always below 5 μm and thus defines the varve boundaries. Varve thickness is a function of the annual discharge of suspended load from the catchment. This is supported by evidence from hydrological and meteorological data compiled for a glaciated catchment (Loetschental) adjacent to Oeschinensee. Suspended sediment discharge is related to runoff which in turn is correlated with summer air temperature (correlation coefficients 0.66 and 0.70 respectively). Between AD 1962 and 1982, annual thicknesses of the Oeschinensee varve record showed a positive correlation with the average summer air temperature of the region (correlation coefficient 0.44). },

  Abstract                 = {Diatom analyses with an annual resolution were carried out on varves of the hypertrophic Baldeggersee (Central Swiss Plateau) for the timespan ad 1885 to 1993. They reveal seven major changes in the dominant planktonic diatoms. As a result of progressive nutrient enrichment, Baldeggersee changed in the 1910s from a Cyclotella to a Tabellaria fenestrata dominated assemblage, and eventually in the 1950s to a Stephanodiscus parvus dominated diatom assemblage. The timing and direction of diatom-assemblage changes in the varved sediment compare well with sedimentological and limnological observations. Partitioning of the variance in the diatom data revealed that TP is a stronger explanatory variable than temperature for these changes. A diatom-inferred total phosphorus (TP) reconstruction indicates three major steps in eutrophication, occurring at 1909, the mid-1950s and the mid-1970s. Comparison with TP measurements in the water column demonstrates that the diatom-TP inference model used is able to hindcast past TP concentrations reliably. The major steps in eutrophication led to decreases in diatom diversity and also resulted in a progressive increase of calcite grain-size. The lake restoration programme established since 1982 shows no direct impact on the composition of the diatom assemblages. However, the decrease in phosphorus loads since the mid-1970s is reflected in the diatom assemblages and in decreasing diatom-inferred TP concentrations.},

These all involve lakes with annually-laminated sediments. They concern the comparison of annual sediment records with instrumental data to study the effects of nutrients and climate on the Swiss lake of Baldeggersee; the comparison of diatom stratigraphical data and tree-ring based climate at Kassj{\"o}n, a lake in central-northern Sweden; and the assessment of the effects of volcanic tephra deposition and climatic change on pollen and diatom stratigraphical assemblages at Holzmaar in west-central Germany. These case studies highlight the need for careful definition of the research question or hypothesis to be tested, the selection of ecologically relevant response proxies, the critical choice of predictor variables as proxies for stress and environmental change, and the selection of appropriate numerical and statistical techniques.},

  Abstract                 = {Arctic aquatic systems are considered to be especially sensitive to anthropogenic disturbance, which can have cascading effects on biological communities as aquatic food-web structure is altered. Bio-indicators that respond to major limnological changes can be used to detect and infer major environmental change, such as climate warming, with the use of paleolimnological techniques. A multi-proxy approach was used to quantify recent environmental changes at Baker Lake, Nunavut, Arctic Canada. Analyses of fossilized remains of chironomids and diatoms were conducted on a sediment core of 20 cm in length sampled at 0.5-cm intervals. A new surface sediment training set of subfossil chironomid assemblages from 65 lakes across the eastern Canadian Arctic generated a robust (r jack 2 = 0.79) surface water paleotemperature transfer function. The transfer function was applied to stratigraphic intervals from the Baker Lake sediment core to generate a paleotemperature reconstruction of sub-decadal resolution. The surface water temperature reconstruction inferred a 2{\textdegree}C increase in mid-summer surface water temperature for Baker Lake over the last 60 years, which was corroborated by the local instrumental record spanning the period of 1950--2007 AD. The chironomid record shows a recent decline of several cold-water taxa and appearance of warm-water indicators. This shift in community structure began circa 1906 AD, and intensified after 1940 AD. The corresponding fossil diatom record showed an increase in small planktonic Cyclotella taxa over the past 60 years, intensifying in the last 5 years, which also suggests a warmer climate and longer ice-free periods. The shifts in the diatom assemblages began later than the shifts in the chironomid assemblages, and were of lower magnitude, reflecting differences in the mechanisms in which these two indicators respond to environmental change.},

The corresponding LT 50 values were ca 205 and 100 d. There was no statistically significant difference between the survival in anoxia and in aerated water, which indicates that the main reason for death in anoxia is not the absence of oxygen. This main reason is presumed to be starvation. The presence of undissociated H2 S in low concentrations (ca $1.2\ {\rm mg}\ {\rm l}^{-1}$) did not influence the survival. In anoxia the larvae were usually motionless and did not feed but they increased in weight due to uptake of water. During 43 d C. plumosus and C. anthracinus increased ca. 10%.},

  Abstract                 = { Clastic-biogenic varved lake sediments from Nautajärvi, Finland, covering the last ca. 10 000 years have previously been investigated with respect to varve chronology, laminae composition and thickness variations, palaeomagnetic secular variation, the pollen record and the diatom composition of selected sections. In this study, we provide detailed information on the seasonal sedimentation of different varve components and palaeolimnological indicators (diatoms, chrysophycaean cysts) using near-bottom sediment-trap monitoring. The monitoring results confirm previous interpretations of the formation of clastic-biogenic varves in Fennoscandian lakes. The results also indicate that seasonal sediment fluxes correspond with environmental changes. Higher snow storage in winter and the discharge intensity during the following spring snowmelt clearly increase the suspended sediment load, transportation and net accumulation of detrital mineral matter during spring and early summer. A prolonged autumn and subsequent freezing and thawing cycles in winter, conversely, result in an incremental but slow accumulation of assorted mineral matter and organic particles during winter, whereas the subsequent spring flooding and detrital sediment yield are diminished and thinner clastic laminae are formed. The accumulation rates of diatoms and chrysophyte cysts suggest that these algal groups are more dependent on seasonal processes (e.g. spring and autumnal overturn) than on rapid, short-lived environmental episodes such as the spring discharge peak. },

The density of larvae in the study area varied from a low of 16,368 larvae m−2 in August 1989 to maximum values of 106,249 and 129,954 larvae m−2 in June 1989 and May 1990, respectively. During spring and early summer, first instar larvae comprised approximately half of the larval population. No significant differences were found in seasonal vertical distribution of the chironomid larvae.

To elucidate their spatio-temporal pattern, we reconstructed past temperatures for seven continental-scale regions during the past one to two millennia. The most coherent feature in nearly all of the regional temperature reconstructions is a long-term cooling trend, which ended late in the nineteenth century. At multi-decadal to centennial scales, temperature variability shows distinctly different regional patterns, with more similarity within each hemisphere than between them. There were no globally synchronous multi-decadal warm or cold intervals that define a worldwide Medieval Warm Period or Little Ice Age, but all reconstructions show generally cold conditions between ad 1580 and 1880, punctuated in some regions by warm decades during the eighteenth century. The transition to these colder conditions occurred earlier in the Arctic, Europe and Asia than in North America or the Southern Hemisphere regions. Recent warming reversed the long-term cooling; during the period ad 1971-2000, the area-weighted average reconstructed temperature was higher than any other time in nearly 1,400 years.},

  Abstract                 = { 3 m of annually laminated sediments were recovered from a small steep-sided lake, Diss Mere, Norfolk, UK. In an 8 cm section, known to include the mid-Holocene 'elm decline', the laminae were sampled separately, as far as possible, resulting in 181 samples covering 252 years. Relative pollen percentages, pollen influx, and charcoal were analysed. They show evidence of two phases of human disturbance within the woodland around the Mere, the first starting at least 160 years before the 'elm decline', and involving cereal growth. At the 'elm decline', Ulmus pollen values fall by 73\% over six years. This is comparable in rate and magnitude with the fall, as recorded palynologically, in Castanea dentata from North America known to have been caused by a pathogen earlier this century, with the mid-Holocene Tsuga canadensis decline also attributed to a pathogen, and with the present-day Ulmus decline caused by Dutch elm disease at Scords Wood, England. Exponential and logistic models of population change are applied to the Diss Mere Ulmus decline data. The form, magnitude, and rate of decrease of the Ulmus decline at Diss Mere are all consistent with the hypothesis of a pathogenic attack. All the available evidence from Diss supports the hypothesis that the mid-Holocene 'elm decline' was caused by a combination of disease and human activity. },

  Abstract                 = {Varved lake sediments provide opportunities for high-resolution paleolimnological investigations that may extend monitoring surveys in order to target priority management actions under climate warming. This paper provides the synthesis of an international research program relying on >150 years-long, varved records for three managed perialpine lakes in Europe (Lakes Geneva, Annecy and Bourget). The dynamics of the dominant, local human pressures, as well as the ecological responses in the pelagic, benthic and littoral habitats were reconstructed using classical and newly developed paleo-proxies. Statistical modelling achieved the hierarchization of the drivers of their ecological trajectories. All three lakes underwent different levels of eutrophication in the first half of the XXth century, followed by re-oligotrophication. Climate warming came along with a 2°C increase in air temperature over the last century, to which lakes were unequally thermally vulnerable. Unsurprisingly, phosphorous concentration has been the dominant ecological driver over the last century. Yet, other human-influenced, local environmental drivers (fisheries management practices, river regulations) have also significantly inflected ecological trajectories. Climate change has been impacting all habitats at rates that, in some cases, exceeded those of local factors. The amplitude and ecological responses to similar climate change varied between lakes, but, at least for pelagic habitats, rather depended on the intensity of local human pressures than on the thermal effect of climate change. Deep habitats yet showed higher sensitivity to climate change but substantial influence of river flows. As a consequence, adapted local management strategies, fully integrating nutrient inputs, fisheries management and hydrological regulations, may enable mitigating the deleterious consequences of ongoing climate change on these ecosystems.},

  Abstract                 = {Climate change involves alterations in seasonality as well as shifts in mean annual temperature. Cold temperate lakes show strong seasonality, with winter ice cover and alternating mixing and stratification periods during the ice-free season. These physical changes are ultimately related to seasonal weather variation and also drive annual phytoplankton succession. Therefore, phytoplankton remains in lake sediment records are potentially useful for reconstructing past seasonal climate signals. With the exception of investigations on varved sediments, however, little research has been carried out on the subject. Here we present two lines of evidence demonstrating that chrysophyte stomatocysts can be useful for inferring past climatic seasonality. First, we show that marked seasonal stomatocyst replacement is related to periods of the main physical processes in the lake. Second, using instrumental climate data and microfossils in sediment cores, we show that two main components of stomatocyst variability over the last {\textasciitilde}150 years are related to seasonal fluctuations. The first of these components is related to stomatocysts present during summer stratification that respond to general warming trends, particularly in July and August. The second component relates to stomatocysts typically present in the spring and autumn mixing periods. Numbers of these two stomatocyst types vary inversely in response to variation in spring (April--May) temperatures. The number of stomatocyst types affected by spring temperatures is much greater than those related to summer temperatures. We provide evidence that chrysophyte stomatocysts are an excellent proxy for spring air temperature reconstructions, with little influence from summer or general annual trends. We also show that with relatively little effort, it is possible to categorise the chrysophyte stomatocyst assemblage of a lake to carry out detailed investigation of the record of seasonal changes preserved within the sediment.},

  Abstract                 = {The seasonal sedimentation pattern of diatom valves in Lake Holzmaar was investigated during 1995 by deploying sediment traps at three different lake depths. According to the sedimentation pattern, the major reproduction zone of diatoms was restricted to the upper 6 m of the water body. The population growth started late in April and blooms of Cyclotella cf. comensis Grun., which dominates the plankton diatoms, and Fragilaria crotonensis Kitton were collected in traps during June and September, and July, respectively. During summer, the seasonal sedimentation pattern of each taxon, as collected in the upper traps, was reflected in the concentrations in the lowest trap. However, in May and from September onwards, the community composition in the lowest trap and augmented trapping rates suggest both sediment focusing and resuspension of bottom sediments.},

  Abstract                 = {Lake La Cruz is a meromictic, karstic lake with annually laminated sediment formed by summer pulses of calcite deposition. The aim of this study was to explore the potential use of the laminated sediment from Lake La Cruz as a quantitative climate proxy, by calibrating lamina thickness against instrumental climate data. Statistical analysis of the relation between lamina thickness and the meteorological dataset indicated a high correlation between calcium carbonate lamina thickness and rainfall from December to March (r = 0.725, P < 0.01, n = 35). Winter rainfall anomalies in the area are, in turn, highly negatively correlated with the North Atlantic Oscillation index (NAO, r = −0.832; P < 0.01; n = 53). We propose a regression model to infer past winter rainfall from calcium carbonate laminae thickness. These results highlight new possibilities for paleoenvironmental research using calcite laminated sediment records as climate proxies, especially to study past rainfall variability.},

  Abstract                 = { A lack of quantitative high resolution paleoclimate data from the Southern Hemisphere limits the ability to examine current trends within the context of long-term natural climate variability. This study presents a temperature reconstruction for southern Tasmania based on analyses of a sediment core from Duckhole Lake (43.365°S, 146.875°E). The relationship between non-destructive whole core scanning reflectance spectroscopy measurements in the visible spectrum (380–730 nm) and the instrumental temperature record (ad 1911–2000) was used to develop a calibration-in-time reflectance spectroscopy-based temperature model. Results showed that a trough in reflectance from 650 to 700 nm, which represents chlorophyll and its derivatives, was significantly correlated to annual mean temperature. A calibration model was developed (R = 0.56, pauto < 0.05, root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) = 0.21°C, five-year filtered data, calibration period 1911–2000) and applied down-core to reconstruct annual mean temperatures in southern Tasmania over the last c. 950 years. This indicated that temperatures were initially cool c. ad 1050, but steadily increased until the late ad 1100s. After a brief cool period in the ad 1200s, temperatures again increased. Temperatures steadily decreased during the ad 1600s and remained relatively stable until the start of the 20th century when they rapidly decreased, before increasing from ad 1960s onwards. Comparisons with high resolution temperature records from western Tasmania, New Zealand and South America revealed some similarities, but also highlighted differences in temperature variability across the mid-latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere. These are likely due to a combination of factors including the spatial variability in climate between and within regions, and differences between records that document seasonal (i.e. warm season/late summer) versus annual temperature variability. This highlights the need for further records from the mid-latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere in order to constrain past natural spatial and seasonal/annual temperature variability in the region, and to accurately identify and attribute changes to natural variability and/or anthropogenic activities. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The scientific discipline called dendrochronology is the study of tree rings and of environmental conditions and events of the past that tree growth can reflect. The beginning of scientific study of tree rings is generally ascribed to an astronomer named Andrew Ellicott Douglass, who in the early 1900s noticed not only variation in tree‐ring width but also that this variability was similar between multiple trees. Dendrochronology subsequently expanded worldwide, and now over 3000 of the 12,000+ publications on dendrochronology can be classified as dendroclimatology. As a subfield of tree‐ring analysis, dendroclimatology estimates climate back in time beyond the start of recorded meteorological measurements. Dendroclimatology starts with site and tree selection and continues with dating, measuring, data quality control, and chronology construction. Tree rings are associated with climate using statistical models that are then evaluated for their full length to reconstruct climate of the past. Most commonly, either precipitation or temperature is reconstructed, and reconstructions are then analyzed for frequency of extreme years, changes in mean conditions, ranges of long‐term variability, and changes in interannual variability. For example, from reconstructions of Northern Hemisphere temperature based on tree rings and other natural archives of climate collected from multiple sites, it appears that current temperature (since ad 1850) exceeds the range of variability reconstructed for ad 1000‐1850. Uncertainties in dendroclimatology exist, including a relatively recent issue called divergence, but dendroclimatology has played, and continues to play, a substantial role in interdisciplinary research on climate change.

  Abstract                 = { In this article, we accomplish two things. First, we show that despite empirical psychologists’ nominal endorsement of a low rate of false-positive findings (≤ .05), flexibility in data collection, analysis, and reporting dramatically increases actual false-positive rates. In many cases, a researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists than to correctly find evidence that it does not. We present computer simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem. The solution involves six concrete requirements for authors and four guidelines for reviewers, all of which impose a minimal burden on the publication process. },

The results could be compared with information about the planktonic community obtained in the same year. The microscopical structure of the most recent sediment was investigated from a frozen sediment sample taken from the deepest point of the lake two years later, on 30. VIII. 1976. This was done by catching a layer of loose particles from a slightly dried vertical surface of the sediment block on strips of transparent adhesive tape. The layer deposited during 1974 could be identified by the similarity of its diatom succession to that in the sediment traps. Diatom frustules were found to be of special importance in the formation and also in the study of the laminated structure.},

Analyses of the raw data behind these published results provided invaluable confirmation of the initial suspicions, ruling out benign explanations (e.g., reporting errors, unusual distributions), identifying additional signs of fabrication, and also ruling out one of the suspected fraud’s explanations for his anomalous results. If journals, granting agencies, universities, or other entities overseeing research promoted or required data posting, it seems inevitable that fraud would be reduced. },

Varve thickness is positively correlated with July--August--September temperature measured at Clyde River, 70 km to the north of the lake (r = 0.46, p < 0.001). We therefore interpret the variability and trends in varve thickness to partially represent summer temperature. The coolest Little Ice Age temperatures occurred in this record from 1575 to 1760 AD and were approximately 1.5{\textdegree}C cooler than today (average from 1995 to 2005 AD) and 0.2{\textdegree}C cooler than the last millennium (average from 1000 to 2000 AD). Pre-twentieth-century warmth occurred during two intervals, 970--1150 AD and 1375--1575 AD; temperatures were approximately 1.2{\textdegree}C cooler than today, but 0.1{\textdegree}C warmer than the last millennium. The Big Round Lake varve-thickness record contains features similar to that reconstructed elsewhere in the eastern Canadian Arctic. This high-resolution quantitative record expands our understanding of arctic climate during the past millennium.},

  Abstract                 = {The results of nutrient competition experiments performed for all the pairwise combinations of four species of freshwater algae often agreed with the predictions of a graphical model of resource competition. As predicted by theory, the species with the significantly lower resource requirement, as measured by R*, was the superior competitor when both species were limited by the same resource. Two species were observed to coexist only if either (1) each was limited by a different resource and met the theoretical criteria for coexistence or (2) the species were limited by the same resource and did not differ significantly in the their resource requirements. Single-species experiments were used to determine the functional dependence of the growth rate of each Lake Michigan diatom species on the concentration of limiting silicate or phosphate. The results, fit to the Monod (Michaelis-Menten) model, predicted that Fragilaria crotonensis and Asterionella formosa had identical silicate requirements, and that both were silicate competitors superior to Synedra filiformis and Tabellaria flocculosa. The phosphate requirements of the four species were very similar, with Synedra requiring significantly less phosphate than Tabellaria. Competition experiments demonstrated that Tabellaria was competitively displaced by the three other species for all silicate-to-phosphate ratios, as predicted. Asterionella and Fragilaria were apparently competitive equal, coexisting for all silicate-to-phosphate ratios used, suggesting evolution of similar resource requirements by these two commonly dominant species. Asterionella and Synedra coexisted for intermediate silicate-to-phosphate ratios, as did Synedra and Fragilaria.},

  Abstract                 = {As insects belonging to the Endopterygota (or Holometabola), the life cycle of Chironomidae is divided into four distinct stages, i.e. egg, larva, pupa and imago. Notwithstanding the large number of species within the family, chironomids share one conspicuous life history characteristic in that the last two stages are generally very short in duration, while the lengths of egg and larval stages vary substantially between and within species. This seems to be related to the fact that, as in some other aquatic insect orders such as the Ephemeroptera and Plecoptera, chironomid adults mostly rely upon the energy stored during the larval stage to accomplish reproduction, the single most important task assigned to them. Though feeding is known to occur in adults (Chapter 9), this constitutes a tiny proportion of energy acquisition and does not contribute significantly to overall reproductive output, a situation which is clearly different from that of many other related dipterans such as blood-sucking blackflies and mosquitoes. Clear demarcation of energy acquisition and reproduction along the phases of metamorphosis implies that the adult, reproductive phase is heavily dependent on the preceding feeding phase. If a fixed amount of energy is to be allocated to the maintenance of the adult body and gamete production, the highest reproductive output would be achieved by minimizing the length of the adult stage, the strategy that seems to have been adopted by the vast majority of chironomid species.},

  Abstract                 = {High-resolution (annual to sub-decadal) quantitative reconstructions of climate variables are needed from a variety of paleoclimate archives across the world to place current climate change in the context of long-term natural climate variability. Rapid, high-resolution, non-destructive scanning techniques are required to produce such high-resolution records from lake sediments. In this study we explored the potential of scanning reflectance spectroscopy (VIS-RS; 380--730 nm) to produce quantitative summer temperature reconstructions from minerogenic sediments of proglacial, annually laminated Lake Silvaplana, in the eastern Swiss Alps. The scanning resolution was 2 mm, which corresponded to sediment deposition over 1--2 years. We found correlations up to r = 0.84 (p < 0.05) for the calibration period 1864--1950, between six reflectance-dependent variables and summer (JJAS) temperature. These reflectance-dependent variables (e.g. slope of the reflectance 570/630 nm, indicative of illite, biotite and chlorite; minimum reflectance at 690 nm indicative of chlorite) indicate the mineralogical composition of the clastic sediments, which is, in turn, related to climate in the catchment of this particular proglacial lake. We used multiple linear regression (MLR) to establish a calibration model that explains 84{\%} of the variance of summer (JJAS) temperature during the calibration period 1864--1950. We then applied the calibration model downcore to develop a quantitative summer temperature reconstruction extending back to AD 1177. This temperature reconstruction is in good agreement with two independent temperature reconstructions based on documentary data that extend back to AD 1500 and tree ring data that extend back to AD 1177. This study confirms the great potential of in situ scanning reflectance spectroscopy as a novel non-destructive technique to rapidly acquire high-resolution quantitative paleoclimate information from minerogenic lake sediments.},

  Abstract                 = { The construction of accurate age–depth relationships and a realistic assessment of their uncertainties is one of the fundamental prerequisites for comparing and correlating late Quaternary stratigraphical proxy records. Four widely used age–depth modelling routines – CLAM, OxCal, Bacon and Bchron – were tested using radiocarbon dates simulated from varved sediment stratigraphies. All methods produce mean age–depth models that are close to the true varve age, but the uncertainty estimation differs considerably among models. Age uncertainties are usually underestimated by CLAM, whereas age uncertainties produced by Bchron are often too large. With OxCal and Bacon, the setting of model-specific parameters influences the estimated uncertainties, which vary from too large to too small. The variability of sediment accumulation rates is underestimated by CLAM but overestimated by Bacon and Bchron. Bayesian age–depth models mainly improve the assessment of uncertainties of age–depth models. },

  Abstract                 = {Annual PAR (pollen accumulation rates; grains cm−2 year−1) were studied with modified Tauber traps situated in ten regions, in Poland (Roztocze), the Czech Republic (two regions in Krkono{\v{s}}e, two in {\v{S}}umava), Switzerland (4 regions in the Alps), and Georgia (Lagodekhi). The time-series are 10--16 years long, all ending in 2007. We calculated correlations between pollen data and climate. Pollen data are PAR summarized per region (4--7 traps selected per region) for each pollen type (9--14 per region) using log-transformed, detrended medians. Climate data are monthly temperature and precipitation measured at nearby stations, and their averages over all possible 2- to 6-month windows falling within the 20-month window ending with August, just prior to the yearly pollen-trap collection. Most PAR/climate relationships were found to differ both among pollen types and among regions, the latter probably due to differences among the study regions in the habitats of plant populations. Results shared by a number of regions can be summarized as follows. Summer warmth was found to enhance the following year's PAR of Picea, Pinus non-cembra, Larix and Fagus. Cool summers, in contrast, increase the PAR of Abies, Alnus viridis and Gramineae in the following year, while wet summers promote PAR of Quercus and Gramineae. Wetness and warmth in general were found to enhance PAR of Salix. Precipitation was found to be more important for PAR of Alnus glutinosa-type than temperature. Weather did not have an impact on the PAR of Gramineae, and possibly of Cyperaceae in the same year. Care is advised when extrapolating our results to PAR in pollen sequences, because there are large errors associated with PAR from sediments, due to the effects of taphonomy and sedimentation and high uncertainty in dating. In addition, in pollen sequences that have decadal to centennial rather than near-annual resolution, plant-interaction effects may easily out-weigh the weather signal.},

  Abstract                 = {The distribution of benthic invertebrates and their subfossil remains was examined within the basin of De Waay, a dimictic, eutrophic lake in the Netherlands. We focused on Chironomidae, but also report the abundances of 11 invertebrate groups that potentially produce chitinous remains that are preserved in the fossil record, although their remains could only be identified at a coarser taxonomic resolution. Most living invertebrates sampled in different seasons were constrained to the littoral zone, with the exception of a few taxa (Ceratopogonidae, Chaoborus flavicans, and Chironomus) that are adapted to low oxygen conditions in the seasonally anoxic profundal zone. In contrast, assemblages of invertebrate remains in lake surface sediments were similar in the entire lake basin, suggesting that considerable numbers of invertebrate remains are transported and redeposited off-shore in Lake De Waay, due to its steep bathymetry. These results indicate that a single sediment sample obtained from the centre of this lake contains subfossil invertebrate remains originating from the entire lake basin. In Lake De Waay, the majority of taxa found in the living assemblages were identified as remains in lake surface sediments, at least for the Chironomidae that could be identified at a similar taxonomic level in living and subfossil assemblages. Of the total 44 chironomid taxa found in Lake De Waay, 35 taxa occurred in the living assemblages and 34 taxa occurred in the subfossil assemblages. Thirty chironomid taxa occurred both as living and subfossil specimens, and on average these 30 taxa represent 94{\%} of the specimens encountered in a sediment sample. Five rare chironomid taxa present as living larvae were not detected in the subfossil assemblages. Conversely, eight rare and four common chironomid taxa were found in subfossil remains, but not in living assemblages. Our results indicate that subfossil assemblages in surface sediment samples provide spatially integrated and representative samples of the living assemblage. However, a combined approach examining both the living benthic invertebrate fauna and invertebrate remains in lake surface sediments will potentially give a more complete and detailed overview of benthic invertebrates in a lake ecosystem than an approach based exclusively on one of these groups.},

  Abstract                 = {Lake sediment records are underrepresented in comprehensive, quantitative, high-resolution (sub-decadal), multi-proxy climate reconstructions for the past millennium. This is largely a consequence of the difficulty of calibrating biogeochemical lake sediment proxies to meteorological time series (calibration-in-time). Thanks to recent methodological advances, it is now possible. This paper outlines a step-by-step, specifically tailored methodology, with practical suggestions for calibrating and validating biogeochemical proxies from lake sediments to meteorological data. This approach includes: (1) regional climate data; (2) site selection; (3) coring and core selection; (4) core chronology; (5) data acquisition; and (6) data analysis and statistical methods. We present three case studies that used non-varved lake sediments from remote areas in the Central Chilean Andes, where little a priori information was available on the local climate and lakes, or their responses to climate variability. These case studies illustrate the potential value and application of a calibration-in-time approach to non-varved lake sediments for developing quantitative, high-resolution climate reconstructions.},

  Abstract                 = { We present a pigment-based quantitative high-resolution (five years) austral summer DJF (December to February) temperature reconstruction for Central Chile back to AD 850. We used non-destructive in situ multichannel reflection spectrometry data from a short sediment core of Laguna Aculeo (33°50′S/70°54′W, 355 m a.s.l., central Chile). Calibration-in-time (period AD 1901—2000, cross-validated with split periods) revealed robust correlations between local DJF temperatures and total sedimentary chlorin (relative absorption band depth (RABD) centred in 660—670 nm RABD660;670: r=0.79, P<0.01; five-years triangular filtered) and the degree of pigment diagenesis (R660nm/670 nm: r=0.82, P<0.01; five-years triangular filter). Root Mean Squared Error values are small (between 0.24 and 0.34°C) suggesting that most of the reconstructed decadal-scale climate variability is significant. Our data provide quantitative evidence for the presence of a Medieval Climate Anomaly (in this case, warm summers between AD 1150 and 1350; ΔT = +0.27 to +0.37°C with respect to (wrt) twentieth century) and a very cool period synchronous to the ‘Little Ice Age’ starting with a sharp drop between AD 1350 and AD 1400 (−0.3°C/10 yr, decadal trend) followed by constantly cool (ΔT = −0.70 to −0.90°C wrt twentieth century) summers until AD 1750. The structure of variability is consistent in great detail with annually resolved tree-ring based warm-season temperature and river discharge reconstructions from northern Patagonia (42°S) for the past 400 years, with qualitative climate reconstructions from Andean glacier fluctuations, and with hydrological changes in Patagonian lake sediment records. },
