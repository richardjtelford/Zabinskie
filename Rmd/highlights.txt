- Microfossil assemblage-based palaeoenvironmental reconstructions with subdecadal resolution that are validated against instrumental records are reviewed.
- Ecological and taphonomic processes and chronological uncertainty mean that only in favourable circumstances will precise reconstructions be possible.
- Conditions are favourable for reconstructing recent changes in lake nutrient status with diatoms.
- Conditions are not favourable for subdecadal chironomid-temperature reconstructions.
- Serious problems with several of the subdecadal chironomid-temperature reconstructions are discussed.
- Chrysophyte-based reconstructions are difficult to evaluate due to a dearth of archived data.
